# How would I identify PII information on pdfs, including bounding boxes

---
To identify Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in PDFs, including bounding boxes for detected information, you can utilize various tools and methodologies designed for PII detection. Here’s a structured approach:

## Tools and Libraries for PII Detection

1. **Microsoft Presidio**:
    - Presidio is an open-source framework that can analyze documents, including PDFs, to detect PII. It extracts text from PDFs using libraries like `pdfminer`, then identifies PII using pre-defined entity recognizers.
    - The output can include annotations that highlight the detected PII with bounding boxes, making it visually clear where the sensitive information is located in the document[^3].
2. **PII Tools**:
    - This tool supports over 400 file formats, including PDFs. It can dynamically define custom detectors using regex patterns to identify various types of PII such as names, addresses, and financial information.
    - It categorizes detected PII into severity levels (NONE, LOW, HIGH, CRITICAL), which helps prioritize remediation efforts[^2].
3. **Amazon Comprehend**:
    - Amazon Comprehend offers capabilities to detect PII entities in text documents. It can analyze documents in real-time or through batch processing, providing output that includes identified PII types along with their locations[^5].
4. **Google Cloud Sensitive Data Protection**:
    - This service detects sensitive data within images and documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and infoType detectors. It can help identify PII in scanned documents and images[^8].
5. **IRI DarkShield**:
    - DarkShield provides masking functions and can search for PII in PDFs and images. It uses rules defined during data classification to mask sensitive data effectively. The tool addresses challenges specific to PDF formats and OCR limitations[^9].

## Steps to Identify PII in PDFs

1. **Extract Text from PDF**:
    - Use libraries like `pdfminer` or `PyMuPDF` to extract text from the PDF files.
2. **Analyze Text for PII**:
    - Utilize a PII detection library or service (like Microsoft Presidio or Amazon Comprehend) to scan the extracted text for known patterns of sensitive information.
3. **Annotate Detected PII**:
    - Once PII is identified, annotate the original PDF with bounding boxes around detected items. This can be done using libraries that support PDF manipulation, such as `pikepdf` or `reportlab`.
4. **Review and Remediate**:
    - Based on the severity levels assigned by the detection tool, review the identified PII and take necessary actions such as redaction or encryption.

## Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simple example of how you might implement this using Python with Presidio:

```python
from presidio_analyzer import AnalyzerEngine
from presidio_anonymizer import AnonymizerEngine
from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text

# Step 1: Extract text from PDF
pdf_text = extract_text("your_document.pdf")

# Step 2: Analyze text for PII
analyzer = AnalyzerEngine()
results = analyzer.analyze(text=pdf_text, language='en')

# Step 3: Annotate original PDF with bounding boxes
# (Assume you have a function to create bounding boxes based on results)
annotated_pdf = create_bounding_boxes("your_document.pdf", results)

# Save annotated PDF
annotated_pdf.save("annotated_document.pdf")
```

This code outlines the basic steps of extracting text from a PDF, analyzing it for PII, and annotating the original document with the results.

By leveraging these tools and following these steps, you can effectively identify and manage PII in PDF documents while ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.
