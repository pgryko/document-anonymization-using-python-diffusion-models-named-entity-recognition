### Key Points
- Use OCR to convert document images to text, then apply text-based NER tools for best results.
- Two-step approach (OCR + NER) is generally more reliable; end-to-end methods suit poor-quality images.
- Popular tools: Tesseract for OCR, SpaCy for NER; John Snow Labs offers end-to-end solutions.

### What Are the Best Ways?
The most effective way to perform named entity recognition (NER) on images of documents is typically a **two-step approach**: first, use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert the image into text, and then apply a text-based NER tool to identify and classify entities like names, locations, and dates. This method is widely used and reliable, especially for clear, printed documents, as it leverages high-quality OCR tools like Tesseract and advanced NER tools like SpaCy.

For documents with poor image quality, such as handwritten or degraded scans, **end-to-end approaches** that directly process the image to recognize entities can be more suitable. These methods, like John Snow Labs' Visual NLP, integrate computer vision and NLP, potentially handling cases where OCR might fail. Surprisingly, recent studies show the two-step approach can outperform end-to-end methods for handwritten documents, contrary to initial assumptions about OCR errors.

### Choosing the Right Tools
- **OCR Tools**: Start with open-source options like Tesseract ([Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)), or commercial services like Amazon Textract and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services for higher accuracy.
- **NER Tools**: After OCR, use text-based tools like SpaCy ([SpaCy](https://spacy.io/)), NLTK, Stanford NER, or Flair. For specific domains, John Snow Labs' Spark NLP ([Spark NLP](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/)) is highly effective.
- **End-to-End Options**: Consider John Snow Labs' Visual NLP ([Visual NLP](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-nlp/)) for integrated solutions, especially for complex documents, though it may require a subscription.

### Detailed Analysis of Named Entity Recognition from Document Images

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of methods, tools, and challenges for named entity recognition (NER) on document images, expanding on the direct answer with detailed findings from extensive research and analysis.

#### Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves identifying and classifying entities such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more from text, and when applied to document images, it requires handling the visual aspect through techniques like Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The process can be approached in two primary ways: a two-step method (OCR followed by text-based NER) and end-to-end systems that process images directly. This analysis evaluates both approaches, supported by case studies, benchmarks, and tool comparisons, to determine the best practices for various scenarios.

#### Methodology and Research Approach
The investigation began by understanding the task: NER on document images involves extracting text from images (often via OCR) and then recognizing entities. Initial searches focused on general NER methods, but given the image context, the focus shifted to document-specific solutions. Web searches and academic papers were consulted, using platforms like arXiv, SpringerLink, and ACM Digital Library, to identify relevant studies and tools. Function calls included searching for open-source tools, surveys, benchmarks, and case studies, with specific queries like "named entity recognition from document images survey" and "comparison of end-to-end vs two-step approaches."

#### Two-Step Approach: OCR Followed by Text-Based NER
The two-step approach is the most common and effective method for NER on document images. It involves:

- **OCR Step**: Converting the image to text using OCR tools. Popular options include:
  - Tesseract ([Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)), an open-source tool by Google, widely used for its accuracy on printed text.
  - Commercial services like Amazon Textract and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, which offer high accuracy for complex documents.
  - The accuracy of OCR is crucial, as errors can propagate to the NER step. Studies, such as the benchmark on 19th century French directories ([Benchmark](https://www.lre.epita.fr/publications/abadie.22.das/)), highlight the impact of OCR noise on NER performance, showing Transformer-based NER can benefit from fine-tuning on noisy data.

- **NER Step**: Applying text-based NER tools on the extracted text. Options include:
  - SpaCy ([SpaCy](https://spacy.io/)), known for its efficiency and support for multiple languages.
  - NLTK, suitable for research and basic tasks.
  - Stanford NER and Flair, offering advanced deep learning models.
  - John Snow Labs' Spark NLP ([Spark NLP](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/)), particularly effective for domain-specific NER, with over 10,000 models in 250+ languages.

This approach is flexible, allowing users to choose the best tool for each step based on the document type and quality. For instance, a case study on historical documents ([Historical NER Survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3604931)) showed that traditional ML methods like CRF achieve 60–70% F-scores, while deep learning methods like BiLSTM-CRF can reach higher accuracy with appropriate embeddings.

#### End-to-End Approach: Direct Image Processing
End-to-end systems process document images directly to recognize entities, integrating computer vision and NLP. Notable tools include:

- **John Snow Labs' Visual NLP** ([Visual NLP](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-nlp/)), which claims state-of-the-art results with transformer-based models, handling tasks like form summarization and table extraction. It uses "visual tokens" with HOCR format and images, as detailed in a Medium article ([Visual NLP Article](https://medium.com/@spark-nlp/named-entity-recognition-in-documents-with-transformer-models-using-visual-nlp-part-1-44f8c65df8d3)).

- Research papers, such as "DocNER: A Deep Learning System for Named Entity Recognition in Handwritten Document Images" ([DocNER](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-92310-5_28)), compare end-to-end vs. two-step approaches, finding end-to-end methods useful for handwritten documents but often outperformed by two-step methods in accuracy.

A study on handwritten document images ([End-to-End vs Two-Step](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86331-9_52)) showed that the two-stage model achieved higher scores on all tested datasets, challenging the assumption that end-to-end is necessary due to OCR errors. This suggests end-to-end approaches are better suited for scenarios with significant OCR challenges, like historical or noisy images.

#### Comparative Analysis and Benchmarks
Comparisons between the two approaches reveal:

- **Performance**: The two-step approach generally outperforms end-to-end for printed documents with good OCR quality. For example, a benchmark on historical documents ([Historical Benchmark](https://www.lre.epita.fr/publications/abadie.22.das/)) showed Transformer-based NER on OCR text achieving high F-scores with fine-tuning, while end-to-end methods like those in Visual NLP lack direct comparison data in the reviewed sections.

- **Challenges**: Historical documents pose challenges like OCR noise (e.g., 30% F-score drop with 7–20% character error rate, as per [Historical NER Survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3604931)), language dynamics (spelling variations), and lack of resources. End-to-end methods can mitigate some OCR errors but require more computational resources and training data.

- **Case Studies**: Case studies, such as NER on VOC notary records ([Case Study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-031-06555-2_14)), often use OCR followed by NER, highlighting the practicality of the two-step approach. End-to-end methods are less common in open literature, with Visual NLP being a commercial example without public benchmarks against traditional methods in the accessed sections.

#### Tools and Resources
Below is a table summarizing key tools for each approach:

| **Approach**       | **Tool**                     | **Description**                                                                 | **Open-Source** | **URL**                                                                 |

| Two-Step (NER)     | Spark NLP                   | Open-source, domain-specific NER, over 10,000 models                           | Yes           | [Spark NLP](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/)                              |
| End-to-End         | Visual NLP                  | Commercial, integrates CV and NLP, claims state-of-the-art results              | No            | [Visual NLP](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-nlp/)                  |

Additional resources include corpora for historical NER, such as QuaeroOldPress ([QuaeroOldPress](http://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-W0073/)) with 147,682 NEs, and language models like hmBERT ([hmBERT](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz)), useful for multilingual historical texts.

#### Recommendations and Best Practices
For general use, the two-step approach is recommended due to its flexibility and proven accuracy, especially with high-quality OCR. Use Tesseract for OCR and SpaCy for NER for open-source solutions, or commercial services for better accuracy on complex documents. For poor-quality images, consider end-to-end tools like Visual NLP, particularly in domains like healthcare where John Snow Labs offers specialized models ([Healthcare NLP](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare-nlp/)).

Evaluate the trade-offs: the two-step approach requires more steps but leverages mature tools, while end-to-end methods are more integrated but may lack transparency in performance metrics. For historical or noisy documents, fine-tuning NER models on OCR text, as shown in benchmarks ([Historical Benchmark](https://www.lre.epita.fr/publications/abadie.22.das/)), can improve results.

#### Conclusion
The analysis confirms that the two-step approach (OCR + text-based NER) is generally the best for NER on document images, supported by extensive tool availability and benchmarks. End-to-end methods are viable alternatives for challenging cases, with tools like Visual NLP offering integrated solutions, but require further public benchmarks for comparison. This comprehensive approach ensures users can select the most suitable method based on document quality and specific needs.

### Key Points
- Use PDFminer to extract text and coordinates from PDFs.
- Detect PII using Presidio or SpaCy with regular expressions.
- Map PII to bounding boxes by aligning text positions.

### Understanding PII and PDFs
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes data like names, addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers that can identify a person. PDFs can contain this information in text or images, making extraction challenging. To find PII and its location (bounding boxes), we need tools to extract text with positions and identify PII patterns.

### Extracting Text with Coordinates
Use PDFminer, a Python library, to extract text and its bounding boxes from PDFs. This gives us the exact location of each text piece, essential for mapping PII later.

### Detecting PII in Text
For PII detection, use Presidio, an open-source tool, or SpaCy for named entity recognition, combined with regular expressions for structured data like phone numbers. This identifies where PII appears in the text.

### Mapping PII to Bounding Boxes
After detecting PII, map its position in the text back to the PDF using the coordinates from PDFminer. Combine bounding boxes if PII spans multiple text fragments to get the final location.

### Surprising Detail: Image-Based PDFs
For scanned PDFs, convert to images using tools like pdf2image and use Presidio's image processing to detect PII, as text extraction might not work directly.

### Comprehensive Analysis of Identifying PII in PDFs with Bounding Boxes

This section provides a detailed exploration of the methods and tools for identifying Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in PDF files, including their bounding boxes, catering to both technical and non-technical audiences seeking a thorough understanding.

#### Introduction to PII and PDF Challenges
PII encompasses data that can identify an individual, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and social security numbers. PDFs, created by Adobe, are versatile but complex, often containing text, images, tables, and other elements. The challenge lies in extracting this information accurately, especially when PII is embedded in images or has varying layouts, and determining its precise location (bounding boxes) within the document.

The process involves two main steps: extracting text and coordinates from the PDF, and then detecting PII within that text while mapping it back to its original position. This analysis covers both text-based and image-based PDFs, addressing potential complexities like encrypted content, redacted text, and multi-language documents.

#### Methodology for Text-Based PDFs
For PDFs with extractable text, the following structured approach is recommended:

1. **Text Extraction with Coordinates:**
   - Utilize PDFminer, a Python library designed for PDF text extraction, to retrieve text along with their bounding boxes. PDFminer can parse the PDF and provide coordinates for each character or word, essential for locating PII.
   - Example: Extracting text might yield outputs like "489, 41, 'Signature'" for position and text, as seen in discussions on Stack Overflow ([How to extract text and text coordinates from a PDF file?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22898145/how-to-extract-text-and-text-coordinates-from-a-pdf-file)).
   - This step handles various PDF structures, though accuracy may vary with complex layouts like tables or overlapping text.

2. **PII Detection in Extracted Text:**
   - Employ Presidio, an open-source data protection SDK by Microsoft, for comprehensive PII detection. Presidio uses Named Entity Recognition (NER), regular expressions, rule-based logic, and checksums, supporting multiple PII types like credit card numbers, names, and locations.
   - Alternatively, use SpaCy, a popular NLP library, for NER to identify entities like persons and locations, supplemented by regular expressions for structured data (e.g., email: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b` for emails, phone numbers with various formats).
   - Presidio provides start and end indices for detected PII, as shown in its documentation ([Customizing Presidio Analyzer](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/samples/python/customizing_presidio_analyzer/)), enabling precise location mapping.

3. **Mapping PII to Bounding Boxes:**
   - After detection, map the PII indices back to the original PDF positions. This involves:
     - Concatenating the extracted text to form a full text, tracking each fragment's start and end indices.
     - For each PII, identify corresponding text fragments using these indices.
     - Collect bounding boxes of these fragments and combine them (e.g., take minimum and maximum coordinates for x and y to form a rectangle) to get the overall bounding box.
   - Challenges include ensuring text order accuracy, especially with complex layouts, and handling PII spanning multiple lines or words.

#### Handling Image-Based PDFs (Scanned Documents)
For PDFs with images (e.g., scanned documents), direct text extraction may fail, requiring OCR (Optical Character Recognition):

- Convert PDFs to images using libraries like `pdf2image`, as demonstrated in a Medium article ([PII Detection in Multiple File Type](https://pball01.medium.com/pii-detection-in-multiple-file-type-6ba3d0a5cfe4)).
- Use Presidio's image redactor module, which processes images via OCR and detects PII, providing bounding boxes in the output. For example, redacted images show PII covered with black boxes, indicating detected locations.
- This method is necessary for non-textual PDFs but may be less accurate due to OCR limitations, especially with poor-quality scans.

#### Tools and Libraries Overview
The following table summarizes key tools and their functionalities for PII detection in PDFs:

| **Tool/Library** | **Primary Use**                          | **Supports Bounding Boxes** | **Open Source** | **Additional Notes**                     |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| PDFminer          | Text extraction with coordinates         | Yes                         | Yes             | Python library, handles complex layouts  |
| Presidio          | PII detection in text and images         | Yes (via image module)       | Yes             | Microsoft project, supports multiple PII types |
| SpaCy             | Named entity recognition                 | No (needs integration)       | Yes             | Good for names, locations, needs regex for others |
| PII Tools         | Commercial PII detection in PDFs          | Yes                         | No              | API-based, may require subscription      |
| Amazon Comprehend | PII detection in text                    | No (character offsets only)  | No              | Cloud service, no direct PDF bounding box support |

#### Commercial and Alternative Solutions
For users preferring ready-made solutions, commercial tools like PII Tools offer API-based PII detection with bounding boxes, as seen in their documentation ([PII Tools documentation](https://documentation.pii-tools.com/)). These tools are suitable for enterprises but may involve costs. Amazon Comprehend and Azure AI Language provide PII detection but lack explicit bounding box support for PDFs, focusing on text offsets ([Detecting PII entities - Amazon Comprehend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-pii.html)).

#### Challenges and Considerations
- **Accuracy and Layout:** PDFs with complex layouts (tables, footnotes) may affect text extraction order, impacting index mapping. PDFminer's heuristics help, but manual validation may be needed.
- **Language Support:** The method assumes English text; for other languages, ensure NER models (e.g., SpaCy, Presidio) support the language, or use language-specific regex.
- **Encrypted PDFs:** Ensure PDFs are accessible; encrypted or protected content may block extraction, requiring decryption first.
- **Multiple Occurrences:** Ensure all PII instances are detected, as the same information may appear multiple times.
- **Redacted or Obscured PII:** Partially redacted PII may be harder to detect, requiring robust detection logic.

#### Implementation Example
For a Python implementation, consider:
- Install PDFminer: `pip install pdfminer.six`
- Install Presidio: `pip install presidio-analyzer`
- Extract text with PDFminer, detect PII with Presidio, and map back using indices, as outlined in the methodology.

#### Surprising Insights
A notable finding is the dual approach for PDFs: text-based extraction for digital PDFs and image-based OCR for scanned documents, highlighting the versatility required. The integration of open-source tools like Presidio for both text and images, as seen in Medium articles, is particularly effective for cost-conscious users.

#### Conclusion
Identifying PII in PDFs with bounding boxes involves extracting text and coordinates, detecting PII using advanced tools, and mapping back to positions. For text-based PDFs, PDFminer with Presidio or SpaCy offers a robust solution; for image-based PDFs, Presidio's image module via OCR is essential. This comprehensive approach ensures accuracy and compliance with data privacy needs, suitable for both programmatic and commercial applications.
